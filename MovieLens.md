# Tableau Visualization - Movie Rating Dataset from MovieLens


This dataset is collected from a movie recommendation service called MovieLens.  It describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity collected from the site.  The dataset comes in 3 sizes: _Small_, _20M_, and _Full_.  For the purpose of visualization with Tableau and data exploratory, I had to use with _Small_, because of the limitations of Tableau.  I look forward to analyzing the full dataset when Udacity figure out the Tableau Licenses for DAND students.    

## About _Small_ Dataset      
It contains 100004 ratings and 1296 tag applications across 9125 movies. These data were created by 671 users between January 09, 1995 and October 16, 2016. This dataset was generated on October 17, 2016.  

Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.

The data are contained in four files links.csv, movies.csv, ratings.csv and tags.csv.
